This directory contains the code for the cart and pendulum example in section 6.1 of
"Building Software for Simulation". Run the bash script 'build.sh' to construct three
executables: idealsim, mop, and inverted_pendulum. The executable 'idealsim' is
the ideal system in which the communication network imposes neither delay nor
lost data. The second executable 'mop' is used to calculate the metric of
performance for the control system. The third executable 'inverted_pendulum'
is the simulator that uses OMNET++ to model the Ethernet separating controller
and sensor.

The two simulators produces the output files 's.dat' and 'y.dat'. The file 's.dat' has the
arm angle of the cart. The file 'y.dat' has the output of the arm angle sensor. The
data is in two columns, the first for time (in seconds) and the second for the angle
(in degrees).

To build and execute this model you must install OMNET++ and its Inet extension.
These are available on the web at http://www.omnetpp.org/. You will need to edit
build.sh so that the OMNET_HOME and points to the directory where OMNET is installed
and INET_PROJ to point to where the Inet extensions are installed. Depending
on your compiler, the file Makefile.ideal will also need to be adjusted for
compiler flags and link libraries.

When the simulators are built, the experiments in the book can be repeated
with the bash script 'run.sh'. This script also provides an example of how
to execute the OMNET++ simulator.
