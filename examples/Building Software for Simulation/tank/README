This directory contains the source code for the interactive simulation of the
robotic tank, its controller, and the several simulation experiments discussed
in "Building Software for Simulation". The Makefile in this directory assumes
that you are using the GNU C++ compiler. The several make targets are described
in the makefile. All of the examples except the interactive simulator should
build without any additional libraries. The interactive simulator requires the
following:

SDL, use the last in the 1.2 series of releases, get it from www.libsdl.org
GNU Common C++, get it from http://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp/
OpenGL's GLUT and GL libraries, which are installed with most Linux distributions

If you are using Windows or Mac OSX, you'll need to find ports of these libraries
for your operating system. SDL, GL, and GLUT are available for most platforms
(Windows support for GLUT and GL is spotty though). The GNU Common C++ library
is used for communicating with the human interface of the tank via a UDP
socket (see SimControl.cpp and SimControl.h). You may want to simply
rewrite the UDPSocket and IPV4Address classes using a native API.

The controller for the tank is written in Java, and the source code is located
in the controller directory. To compile it, just issue the command

javac Terminal.java

and use 

java Terminal

to execute the controller. It is designed to use a gamepad (as described
in the book), and you need the Java bindings to the SDL for this to work.
You can get these from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdljava/. If you
have a gamepad with two sticks then you are ready to go. The left stick
will accelerate (push up) or decelerate (push back). The right stick
turns the tank to the left (push left) and right (push right).

The controller and tank use the address 127.0.0.1 and port 10000 by default.
The address bound by each can be set on the command line (or you could
reprogram the default).
