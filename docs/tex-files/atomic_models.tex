\chapter{Atomic Models}
\label{section:atomic_models}
Atomic models are the basic building blocks of a DEVS model. The behavior of an atomic model is
described by its state transition functions (internal, external, and
confluent), its output function, and its time advance function.
Within \adevs, these aspects of an atomic model are implemented by
sub-classing the \classname{Atomic} class and implementing the pure virtual
methods that correspond to the internal, external, confluent,
output, and time advance functions.

The state of an atomic model is represented by the attributes of the
class that implements the model.  The internal transition function describes
how the state evolves in the absence of input. The time advance function
is used to schedule internal changes of state, and the output function gives
the model output when these internal events occur. The external transition function describes
how the system state changes in response to input.  The confluent transition function
handles the simultaneous occurrence of an internal and external event. The types of objects
that can be accepted as input and output are specified with a template argument
to the \classname{Atomic} base class.

The \classname{Clerk} described in Section \ref{chapter:intro} demonstrates all of the aspects of an \classname{Atomic} model. We'll use it to demonstrate how an every \classname{Atomic} model generates output, processes input events, and schedules self-events. Here is the \classname{Clerk}'s class definition:
\begin{verbatim}
include "adevs.h"
#include "Customer.h"
#include <list>

class Clerk: public adevs::Atomic<IO_Type> 
{
    public:
        /// Constructor.

        /// Internal transition function.
        void delta_int();
        /// External transition function.
        void delta_ext(double e, const adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& xb);
        /// Confluent transition function.
        void delta_conf(const adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& xb);
        /// Output function.  
        void output_func(adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& yb);
        /// Time advance function.
        double ta();
        /// Output value garbage collection.
        void gc_output(adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& g);
        /// Destructor.
        ~Clerk();
        /// Model input port.
        static const int arrive;
        /// Model output port.
        static const int depart;

    private:

        double t;
        /// List of waiting customers.

    }
}
\end{verbatim}

Consider a simulation
of the store with the same sequence of customer arrivals that were
used in Section \ref{chapter:intro} (i.e., listed in Table \ref{tab:customer_data}); I've listed the data again here: 
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Enter checkout line & Time to process order \\ \hline
1 & 1 \\ \hline
2 & 4 \\ \hline
3 & 4 \\ \hline
5 & 2 \\ \hline
7 & 10 \\ \hline
8 & 20 \\ \hline
10 & 2 \\ \hline
11 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Customer arrival times and time to process customer orders.}
\label{tab:customer_data_again}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:customer_data_again} describes an input sequence that is fed to the \classname{Clerk} model. The algorithm for processing this, or any other, input sequence is listed below. The \classname{Atomic} model that is being simulated is called `model', t is the current simulation time (i.e., the last event time), and t\_input is the time stamp of the smallest unprocessed event in the input sequence. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set the next event time tN to the smaller of the next internal event time t\_self = t + model.ta() and the next input event time t\_input.
\item If t\_self = tN and t\_input < tN then produce an output event at time t\_self by calling model.output\_func() and then compute the next state by calling model.delta\_int().
\item If t\_self = t\_input = tN then produce an output event at time t\_self by calling model.output\_func() and compute the next state by calling model.delta\_conf(x) where x contains the input events scheduled at time t\_input.
\item If t\_self < tN and t\_input = tN then compute the next state by calling model.delta\_ext(t\_input-t,x), where x contains the input events schedule at time t\_input.
\item Set t equal to tN.
\item Repeat if there are more input or self events to process.
\end{enumerate}

The simulation runs until there are no internal or external events to process. The first step of the algorithm computes the next event time by taking the smaller of the next input event time and the next self event time. If the next self event happens first, then the model produces an output and its next state is computed with the internal transition function. If the next input event happens first, then the next state of the model is computed with the external transition function; no output event is produces in this case. The elapsed time argument to the external transition function is the amount of time that has passed since the previous event at that model. If the next input and self event happen at the same time, then the model produces an output and the next model state is computed with the confluent transition function. The simulation clock is then advanced to the event time and these steps are repeated.

The execution trace resulting from the
customer arrival sequence in Table \ref{tab:customer_data_again} is shown below. It has been broken up to show where each simulation cycle begins and ends and the type of event occurring in each cycle.

Now let's define a more complicated clerk
model that will interrupt the checkout of one customer in order to
more quickly serve customers with very small orders. This new clerk
operates as follows. If a customer is being served and another
customer arrives whose order can be processed very quickly, then the
clerk stops serving the current customer and begins serving the new
customer. The clerk, however, will only do this occasionally. To be
precise, let's say that a small order is one that requires no more
than a single unit of time to process. Moreover, the clerk will not
interrupt the processing of an order more often than every 10 units
of time. 

The new clerk model has two state variables. The first state
variable records the amount of time that must elapsed before the
clerk is willing to preempt the processing of one customer 
to serve a customer with a small order. The second is the list of
customers waiting to be served. Here is the header file for the new
clerk model, which we will call \classname{Clerk2}.
\begin{verbatim}
#include "adevs.h"
#include "Customer.h"
#include <list>

class Clerk2: public adevs::Atomic<IO_Type> 
{
    public:
        /// Constructor.
        Clerk2();
        /// Internal transition function.
        void delta_int();
        /// External transition function.
        void delta_ext(double e, const adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& xb);
        /// Confluent transition function.
        void delta_conf(const adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& xb);
        /// Time advance function.
        double ta();
        /// Output function.  
        void output_func(adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& yb);
        /// Output value garbage collection.
        void gc_output(adevs::Bag<IO_Type>& g);
        /// Destructor.
        ~Clerk2();
        /// Model input port.
        static const int arrive;
        /// Model output port.
        static const int depart;
    private:    
        /// Structure for storing information about customers in the line
        struct customer_info_t
        {
            // The customer
            Customer* customer;
            // Time remaining to process the customer order
            double t_left;
        };
        /// List of waiting customers.
        std::list<customer_info_t> line;
        //// Time before we can preempt another customer
        double preempt;
        /// The clerk's clock
        double t;
        /// Threshold correspond to a 'small' order processing time
        static const double SMALL_ORDER;
        /// Minimum time between preemptions.
        static const double PREEMPT_TIME;
}; 
\end{verbatim}

The \classname{Clerk2} constructor sets the clerk's clock and preemption timer to zero.
\begin{verbatim}
Clerk2::Clerk2():
Atomic<IO_Type>(),
preempt(0.0),
t(0.0)
{
}
\end{verbatim}
The output function of the \classname{Clerk2} model sets the exit time of the departing customer and then ejects the customer via its ``depart" port.
\begin{verbatim}
void Clerk2::output_func(Bag<IO_Type>& yb)
{
    /// Set the exit time of the departing customer
    line.front().customer->tleave = t+ta();
    /// Place the customer at the front of the line onto the depart port.
    IO_Type y(depart,line.front().customer);
    yb.insert(y);
    // Report the departure
    cout << "Clerk: A customer departed at t = " << t+ta() << endl;
}
\end{verbatim}

The \classname{Clerk2}'s external transition function is
significantly different its predecessor. When a new customer
arrives, the first thing that the clerk does is reduce the
checkout time of the customer that is currently being processed. This
reduction reflects the amount of time that has already been
spent on the customer's order, which is the time elapsed since the
\classname{Clerk2}'s last state transition. Next, the preemption wait time is reduced and the clock is incremented by
the same amount. The \classname{Clerk2} records the time at
which each arriving customer enters the line; this time is the value of the clock. If any of the arriving customers has a small checkout time
and the preemption wait time has expired, then that customer goes to
the front of the line. Notice that this preempts the current
customer, who now has the second place in line, and causes the
preempt wait time to be reset. Otherwise, the new customer simply
goes to the back of the line. 
\begin{verbatim}
void Clerk2::delta_ext(double e, const Bag<IO_Type>& xb)
{
    /// Update the clock
    t += e;
    /// Update the time spent working on the current order
    if (!line.empty())
    {
        line.front().t_left -= e;
    }
    /// Reduce the preempt time
    preempt -= e;
    /// Place new customers into the line
    Bag<IO_Type>::const_iterator iter = xb.begin();
    for (; iter != xb.end(); iter++)
    {
        cout << "Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = " << t << endl;
        /// Create a copy of the incoming customer and set the entry time
        customer_info_t c;
        c.customer = new Customer(*((*iter).value));
        c.t_left = c.customer->twait;
        /// Record the time at which the customer enters the line
        c.customer->tenter = t;
        /// If the customer has a small order
        if (preempt <= 0.0 && c.t_left <= SMALL_ORDER)
        {
            cout << "Clerk: The new customer has preempted the current one!" << endl;
            /// We won't preempt another customer for at least this long
            preempt = PREEMPT_TIME;
            /// Put the new customer at the front of the line
            line.push_front(c);
        }
        /// otherwise just put the customer at the end of the line
        else 
        {
            cout << "Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line" << endl;
            line.push_back(c);
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

The internal transition function is similar, in many respects, to the
external transition function. It begins by decrementing the preempt
wait time and incrementing the clock by the amount of time that has elapsed since the last state
transition. The customer that just departed the store via the 
output function is then removed from the front of the queue. If the
line is empty then there is nothing else to do and the clerk sits
idly behind her counter. If the preemption wait time has expired
then the clerk scans the line for the first customer with a small
order. If such a customer can be found, that customer moves to
the front of the line. Finally, the clerk starts ringing up the first
customer in her line. Here is the internal transition function for the \classname{Clerk2}
model.
\begin{verbatim}
void Clerk2::delta_int()
{
    // Update the clerk's clock
    t += ta();
    // Update the preemption timer
    preempt -= ta();
    // Remove the departing customer from the front of the line.
    // The departing customer will be deleted later by our garbage
    // collection method.
    line.pop_front();
    // Check to see if any customers are waiting.
    if (line.empty())
    {
        cout << "Clerk: The line is empty at t = " << t << endl;
        return;
    }
    // If the preemption time has passed, then look for a small
    // order that can be promoted to the front of the line.
    list<customer_info_t>::iterator i;
    for (i = line.begin(); i != line.end() && preempt <= 0.0; i++)
    {
        if ((*i).t_left <= SMALL_ORDER)
        {
            cout << "Clerk: A queued customer has a small order at time " << t << endl;
            customer_info_t small_order = *i;
            line.erase(i);
            line.push_front(small_order);
            preempt = PREEMPT_TIME;
            break;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

The time advance function returns the time remaining to process the customer that is at the front of the line, or infinity (DBL\_MAX) if there are no customers to process.
\begin{verbatim}
double Clerk2::ta()
{
    // If the line is empty, then there is nothing to do
    if (line.empty()) return DBL_MAX;
    // Otherwise, wait until the first customer will leave
    else return line.front().t_left;
}
\end{verbatim}

The last function to implement is the confluent transition function.
The \classname{Clerk2} model has the same confluent transition as the \classname{Clerk} that is described in section \ref{chapter:intro}:
\begin{verbatim}
void Clerk2::delta_conf(const Bag<IO_Type>& xb)
{
    delta_int();
    delta_ext(0.0,xb);
}
\end{verbatim}

The behavior of the \classname{Clerk2} model is
significantly more complex than that of the \classname{Clerk} model. To exercise the \classname{Clerk2}, we replace the \classname{Clerk} model in
the example from section \ref{chapter:intro} the \classname{Clerk2} model and perform the same
experiment. Here is the execution output trace for the
\classname{Clerk2} model in response to the input sequence shown in Table \ref{tab:customer_data_again}. This
trace was generated by the print statements shown in the source
code listings for the \classname{Clerk2} model.
\begin{verbatim}
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 1
Clerk: The new customer has preempted the current one!
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 2
Clerk: The line is empty at t = 2
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 2
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 3
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 5
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 6
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 7
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 8
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 10
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 10
Clerk: The new customer is at the back of the line
Clerk: A new customer arrived at t = 11
Clerk: The new customer has preempted the current one!
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 12
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 13
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 23
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 43
Clerk: A customer departed at t = 45
Clerk: The line is empty at t = 45
\end{verbatim}

The evolution of the \classname{Clerk2} line is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:clerk2_line}.  Until time 11, the line evolves just as it did with the \classname{Clerk} model.
At time 11, the \classname{Clerk2} changes the course of the simulation by moving a customer with a small order to the front of the line.
